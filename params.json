  "body": "### EthUSD\r\nEthUSD is a stablecoin pegged to the USD built on the ethereum network. EthUSD acts as as insurance against price volatility of Ether paid for by donations and the deflation of deposited ether.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nTLDR: If the contract has enough funds it'll cover your losses when the price of ether dips. If it doesn't it'll pay out at the current exchange rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurchasing Tokens:\r\n\r\n* EthUSD Tokens Cost $1 USD worth of ether (Plus a 1% fee). USD/ETH exchange rates are currently pulled from Poloniex using oraclize but more fault tolerant solutions are planned.\r\n\r\n* Tokens are created at the time they are purchased from the contract. No tokens are \"Pre-mined\" or created up front. No central authority has access to the ether in the contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelling tokens back to the contract (Withdrawing Ether):\r\n\r\n* If ETH looses value relative to USD and:\r\n  * There is enough ether in the contract to cover the losses and all outstanding tokens:\r\n    - You will receive $1 USD worth of ether for every token you sell back to the contract (Note: This may be more ether than you deposited but it still has the same value in USD.)\r\n\r\n  * There is only enough ether to cover outstanding balances:\r\n    - You will receive the amount of ether you bought in with (Note: this may now be worth less than $1 USD but you haven't lost any more value from EthUSD as you would have from remaining in Ether)\r\n \r\n* If ETH gains value relative to USD: \r\n  -You will receive $1 USD worth of ether for every token you sell back to the contract (Note: This may be less ether than you deposited but it still has the same value in USD.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSince all deposits are always provably covered by the value stored in the contract there isn't a risk of a \"bank run.\" ",
