<p>EthUSD is a stablecoin pegged to the USD built on the ethereum network. EthUSD acts as as insurance against price volatility of Ether paid for by donations and the deflation of deposited ether.</p>

<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h3>

<p>TLDR: If the contract has enough funds it'll cover your losses when the price of ether dips. If it doesn't it'll pay out at the current exchange rate.</p>

<p>Purchasing Tokens:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>EthUSD Tokens Cost $1 USD worth of ether (Plus a 1% fee). USD/ETH exchange rates are currently pulled from Poloniex using oraclize but more fault tolerant solutions are planned.</p></li>
<li><p>Tokens are created at the time they are purchased from the contract. No tokens are "Pre-mined" or created up front. No central authority has access to the ether in the contract.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Selling tokens back to the contract (Withdrawing Ether):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If ETH looses value relative to USD and:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There is enough ether in the contract to cover the losses and all outstanding tokens:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will receive $1 USD worth of ether for every token you sell back to the contract (Note: This may be more ether than you deposited but it still has the same value in USD.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is only enough ether to cover outstanding balances:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will receive the amount of ether you bought in with (Note: this may now be worth less than $1 USD but you haven't lost any more value from EthUSD as you would have from remaining in Ether)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If ETH gains value relative to USD: 
-You will receive $1 USD worth of ether for every token you sell back to the contract (Note: This may be less ether than you deposited but it still has the same value in USD.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since all deposits are always provably covered by the value stored in the contract there isn't a risk of a "bank run." </p>
